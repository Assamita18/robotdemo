sample robot with pageObjects to quickstart


Resource.robot has the target website (currently the OWASP Juice Shop, running locally).

"Page Objects" has models for pages, with some basic functionality; just map the selectors to whatever your need to do.

"Tests" have templates to do repetitive tests with different data.
